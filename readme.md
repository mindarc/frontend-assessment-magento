# Instructions to run the project
* I have created `index.html` inside src folder, which will have two buttons to run the two exercises.
* For `exercise 1`, I tried to make it as simple as possible and used only `HTML`, and `CSS`, there was no need to use any `JS`.


Exercise 2
---
Read the `data.json` file and display the data as tabs on desktop and an accordion on mobile.

##### Requirements
1. Display data in tabs on desktop.
2. Display data in an accordion on mobile.
3. Only 1 accordion/tab should be open at a time.
4. Open the first accordion/tab on load.
5. If the open accordion is selected, close it.

###### Bonus points
* Improve the user experience with meaningful animations/transitions.
* Design and styling.
* Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.
